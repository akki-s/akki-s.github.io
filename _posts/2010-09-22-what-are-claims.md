The security tokens generated by  
[STS](http://techyfreak.blogspot.com/2010/09/what-is-security-token-service-sts.html) 
contain various attributes based on which a grant/deny access is provided or 
based on which user experience is customized. These attributes are called as 
Claims. 

A claim can be a <span class="fullpost">user name, userâ€™s email, it can even 
be permissions such as canWrite, canRead etc or it can be roles or groups to 
which the user belongs. When an  
[STS](http://techyfreak.blogspot.com/2010/09/what-is-security-token-service-sts.html) 
generates a token, it embeds the claims within it; therefore, once a token has 
been issued the values of these claims cannot be tampered with. 

If our application trusts the  
[STS](http://techyfreak.blogspot.com/2010/09/what-is-security-token-service-sts.html) 
that issued this token, it uses the claims issues by the token to describe the 
user, thus eliminating the need to look up user attributes to provide 
authorization and customization.
